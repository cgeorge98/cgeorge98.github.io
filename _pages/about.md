Welcome! I am a computer engineer with interests in hardware security, digital hardware design/architecture, heterogeneous computing, and embedded devices. I am currently a verification engineer at IBM where I conduct functional verification on IBM's ASIC and POWER products.

I earned my M.S. and B.S. in Computer Engineering from [Iowa State University *of* Science and Technology](https://www.iastate.edu). My graduate work focused on hardware security and digital VLSI culminating in a thesis focusing on side-channel analysis of SoCs with a shared cache between heterogenous components. I was awarded a teaching excellence award for my efforts as a teaching assistant where I led laboratory exercises for a graphics architecture course and an undergraduate computer architecture course. My undergraduate work focused on embedded systems and included an additional minor in cybersecurity.
